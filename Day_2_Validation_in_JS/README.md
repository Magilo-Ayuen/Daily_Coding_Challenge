# Simple JavaScript Form Validation

This project demonstrates a simple client-side form validation using vanilla JavaScript. It checks user input before the form is submitted to ensure required fields are filled out correctly.

## Features

- Validates required input fields

- Checks basic input rules (e.g. empty fields, email format)

- Prevents form submission if validation fails

- Displays user-friendly error messages

- Uses plain JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)

# Technologies Used

1. HTML (for structuring)

1. CSS (for styling)

3. JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

# How It Works

1. The user fills out the form.

2. When the form is submitted, JavaScript intercepts the submit event.

3. Each input field is checked based on validation rules.

4. If validation fails:

- The form is not submitted

- Error messages are shown

5. If all fields are valid, the form can be submitted successfully.

# Example Validations

- Required fields cannot be empty

- Email must be in a valid format

- Password length check (if applicable)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the index.html file in your browser.

3. Fill out the form and test the validation behavior.
